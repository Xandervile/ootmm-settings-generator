A settings string generator for customised settings for offline use. Mainly for Weighted Random settings a la Majora's Mask Mystery, where you know what COULD be randomised but it isn't guaranteed, and unlike the Randomise Settings option, this can be weighted for your own choosing.

Added:
- Some weights and settings that I am messing with for Blitz Mystery.
- Script to Encode and Decode settings strings from the OoTMM online patcher so you can add settings yourself.

To do:
- Add Hard Settings Limit and Minimum Settings Desired to the weights file and be read by the program.
