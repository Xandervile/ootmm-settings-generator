A settings string generator for customised settings for offline use. Mainly for Weighted Random settings a la Majora's Mask Mystery, where you know what COULD be randomised but it isn't guaranteed, and unlike the Randomise Settings option, this can be weighted for your own choosing.

Added:
- Some weights and settings that I am messing with for Blitz Mystery.
- Script to Encode and Decode settings strings from the OoTMM online patcher so you can add settings yourself. [REMOVED BECAUSE IT WAS MORE FOR DEBUGGING FOR ME]

To do:
- Add Hard Settings Limit and Minimum Settings Desired to the weights file and be read by the program. [DONE IN PY FILE]

To use:
- Download Python (for dev build) or exe (outdated) and associated weights file
- Put both anywhere but in the same folder
- Adjust weights to your liking (I tried to label them as best I could)
- run python script.
- Open Settings String txt and copy the string into the OoTMM settings string box
