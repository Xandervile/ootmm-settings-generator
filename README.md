A settings string generator for customised settings for offline use. Mainly for Weighted Random settings a la Majora's Mask Mystery, where you know what COULD be randomised but it isn't guaranteed, and unlike the Randomise Settings option, this can be weighted for your own choosing.

Added:
- Some weights and settings that I am messing with for Blitz Mystery.
- Script to Encode and Decode settings strings from the OoTMM online patcher so you can add settings yourself.

To do:
- Make non-blitz variants (most likely MM Only next)
- Make weights use an external file system and an external base settings system like the MM Mystery Settings Generator as of writing.
